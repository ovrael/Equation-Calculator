## Status

Project is _expansionable_.

That means it is finished and I like how it works. But I am open to any issues connected to it (such as bug fix or adding new features in the long long future).

## Why did I create it

The first idea was about finding unknown in equation, but then I changed it up to quite simple program. I think about implement that feature but we're gonna see.
